# Simple URL Sanitizer

Sometimes you just want to share a link with a friend without being canceled by association. Freedom of assembly, or something... 

Anyway, this app gives you a simple way to remove query parameters from any URL. Either launch the app and paste a URL into the text box or share a URL from another app via the Android Sharesheet. 

Uncheck the boxes to remove any tracking parameters from the URL. Have to figure out which ones those are by yourself, though. This app is *simple*, remember? (But at least it will save your selections for next time.)

It is available via the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.banasiak.android.simpleshare).
